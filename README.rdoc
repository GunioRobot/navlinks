= Very light-weight implementation for navigation links

= Providing simple navigation

Add navigation to the layout:

  <ul id="nav">
    <li><%= nav_link_to :home, root_path %></li>
    <li><%= nav_link_to :foo, foo_ath %></li>
  </ul>

Label views to which navigation area they belong to:

=== app/views/pages/home.html.erb
  <%- self.nav_area = :home -%>

=== app/views/foos/show.html.erb

  <%- self.nav_area = :foo -%>

Done!
